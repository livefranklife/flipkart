# Flipkart Clone UI (Frontend Only)

This is a **Flipkart-inspired ecommerce UI clone** built with React (Create React App).  
It is created **only for learning, study and practice purposes** – **not** for real business use, production use, or accepting real payments/orders.

> All product data, prices, offers and images are demo/mocked and may not match real Flipkart data.

## What’s Included

- Home page with Flipkart-like sections (hero banner, category strip, curated product rows).
- Category listing pages with filters and sort options.
- Product detail pages with:
  - Price, discount, offers card
  - Ratings & reviews summary
  - Delivery pincode check (demo)
  - Cart and wishlist actions
- Cart and wishlist pages with quantity updates and price summary.
- Search page with filters (category, rating).
- Seller landing page (`/seller`) inspired by Flipkart Seller Hub.
- Help & policy pages (Contact, Payments, Shipping, Returns, FAQ, Terms, Security, Privacy).
- My Orders page (`/orders`) with a visual order status timeline.
- Global toast notifications, cart preview dropdown, “Recently viewed” strip and back-to-top button.

## Tech Stack

- React (Create React App)

## Running Locally

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
